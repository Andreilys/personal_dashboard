        you wish to calculate directions.

        directions. One of "driving", "walking", "bicycling" or "transit"

        route by routing it through the specified location(s).
    :type waypoints: a single location, or a list of locations, where a
        location is a string, dict, list, or tuple

        indicated features.

    :param units: Specifies the unit system to use when displaying results.

        directions. Note: you can't specify both departure_time and
        arrival_time.

    :param optimize_waypoints: Optimize the provided route by rearranging the
        waypoints in a more efficient order.

        This parameter may only be specified for requests where the mode is
        transit. Valid values are "bus", "subway", "train", "tram", "rail".
        "rail" is equivalent to ["train", "tram", "subway"].

        requests. Valid values are "less_walking" or "fewer_transfers"

        Valid values are "best_guess" or "optimistic" or "pessimistic".
