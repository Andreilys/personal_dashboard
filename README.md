# Personal Dashboard

This is a personal dashboard I built to aggregate and visualize all the different tracking services that track my life. The dashboard is updated in real time and can be found at https://qself-dashboard.herokuapp.com/

- Steps and location data (Moves)
- Chess (lichess.com)
- Weight (Withings smart scale)
- Pomodoro time (Toggl.com)
- Todo's (Todoist)
- Time spent programming (Wakatime)
- Music tastes (Spotify)
